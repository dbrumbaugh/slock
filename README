slock - simple screen locker
============================
simple screen locker utility for X.

Tasks to Complete
-----------------
1. When using PAM auth, the entire screen is recolored,
   rather than just the dwm logo. This "seems" like a 
   simple fix. Worth taking a look at.

Requirements
------------
In order to build slock you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (slock is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install slock
(if necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running slock
-------------
Simply invoke the 'slock' command. To get out of it, enter your password.
